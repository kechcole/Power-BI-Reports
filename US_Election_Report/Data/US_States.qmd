Type of source media: CD–ROM Source scale denominator: 100000 Source contribution: Attribute and geospatial data Date: 20020204 (change 1 of 5) The following steps were performed by ESRI for Data &amp; Maps 2002: Updated geospatial data to match Data &amp; Maps 2002 U.S. Counties. Replaced demographic and agricultural attributes with the latest from Census SF1, ESRI Community, and Census of Agriculture. Recreated ArcView GIS legend file (.avl) and ArcGIS® layer file (.lyr). Copied projection file (.prj). The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted and generalized the features from ArcUSA 1:25M. Added demographic attributes from Summary Tape File-1A (STF-1A) data published by the U.S. Census Bureau based on the 1990 Census of Population. Added farm attributes from data published by the U.S. Census Bureau based on the 1987 Census of Agriculture. Added Pop2000 attribute from ESRI. Converted to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) by splitting the United States into–if present: Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands–and the 48 contiguous states (including District of Columbia); converting each to NAD83; then merging them together. Recalculated any attributes based on area. Added Kalawao county of Hawaii. Created ArcGIS® layer file (.lyr). Created projection file (.prj). Ran ArcView GIS Avenue™ request ExportClean, and created spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC. Data sources used in this process: ArcUSA 1:25M Census SF1 ESRI Community Data USDA Farm Tele Atlas Dynamap/Census Boundaries v4.0 Date: 20040310 (change 2 of 5) The following steps were performed by ESRI: Updated geospatial data to match Data &amp; Maps 2004 U.S. Counties. Merged county (FIPS: 51560) Clifton Forge, VA into (FIPS: 51005) Alleghany, and updated attribute values for (FIPS: 51005) by combining the two. Added county (FIPS: 08014) Broomfield, CO and adjusted surrounding counties (FIPS: 08001) Adams, (FIPS: 08013) Boulder, (FIPS: 08059) Jefferson, and (FIPS: 08123) Weld. Updated attribute values for all five counties (values provided by ESRI). Used null value -99 in the few places where no new values were provided and we did not have the information. Replaced POP2001 with POP2003 from ESRI. Changed attribute name AREA to SQMI. Converted the data set to SDC. Created the projection file (.prj) and spatial indices. Data sources used in this process: ArcUSA 1:25M Census SF1 ESRI Community Data USDA Farm Tele Atlas Dynamap/Census Boundaries v4.0 Tele Atlas Dynamap/2000 v. 14.0 Date: 20050309 (change 3 of 5) The following steps were performed by ESRI: Moved attribute SQMI to the end of the attributes and rounded its values to the nearest tenth of a mile. Replaced attribute POP2003 with POP2004. Added attribute POP04_SQMI and calculated its values. Data sources used in this process: ESRI Community Data Date: 20060410 (change 4 of 5) The following steps were performed by ESRI: Replaced attribute POP2004 with POP2005 and attribute POP04_SQMI with POP05_SQMI. Calculated new values for attributes POP00_SQMI, POP05_SQMI, and SQMI. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS® layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices. Data sources used in this process: ESRI Community Data Date: 20070717 (change 5 of 5) The following steps were performed by ESRI: Replaced attribute POP2005 with POP2007 and attribute POP05_SQMI with POP07_SQMI. Calculated new values for POP07_SQMI. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS® layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.
